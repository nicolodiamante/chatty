<br><br>

Integrating ChatGPT is fairly straightforward. However, it requires certain specific prerequisites and links for seamless functioning.
<br><br>

## Requirements to get ChatGPT to work with Siri

### Get the Shortcut

To initiate, first download the [Apple Shortcuts][apple-shortcuts-download] app followed by the [Chatty Shortcut][chatty-shortcut]. Feel free to rename the shortcut to a title of your preference. However, before you begin using it, ensure that you continue reading for further instructions.

  </a>
</p>

<br>

> Please make sure to complete the following tasks when transitioning to the new version: Decode the API keys that were previously stored in an encrypted format in the Data Jar. To simplify this process, use the [DecodeMe][decode-key-shortcut] shortcut. Remember to complete this for each key of OpenAI's and ElevenLabs.

<br><br>

### Create your OpenAI API Key

To utilise ChatGPT's services with Siri, it is essential to obtain an OpenAI API key. In order to acquire this key, you need to generate a new secret key from your existing OpenAI account. If you don't possess an OpenAI account yet, you can easily create one by following this [link][openai-signup]. This secret key plays a crucial role in verifying your authentication. Here are the steps on how to do it:

1. Log in to your [OpenAI account][openai-account].
2. Search for the ‘Create new secret key’ option and click on it.

  </picture>
</p>

Once you obtain the [API Key][openai-API], incorporating ChatGPT's services with Siri is straightforward. It's important to remember, after making a copy of the key and closing the pop-up, you won't have access to it again. Therefore, store the key securely in a safe location.
<br><br>

</p>

<br>

## How to set up and use ChatGPT with Siri

### Setting Up

After downloading the shortcut and copying your API key, follow these steps to put it to use:

- Begin by opening the Shortcuts app and finding the downloaded Chatty shortcut.

- Upon activating the ‘Chatty’ shortcut, you'll need to enter your OpenAI API key. You can choose to store this key either directly in the shortcut or in the Data Jar app. However, if you choose to store the key in the shortcut, it's crucial to ensure their privacy. Any inadvertent exposure could compromise your security and potentially result in a breach.

- Next, continue with the configuration procedure. Follow each essential step attentively to customise the outcome prompt based on your specific preferences for the shortcut. Once finished, you can start using 'Chatty' right away.

<br>

  </picture>
</p>

<br>

All set! After completing the integration, you can initiate the shortcut simply by tapping it inside the app or from your Mac's menu bar. If desired, you could also activate the shortcut using Siri. When ready, just say ‘Chatty’ and follow it up with your question or prompt. The shortcut will then generate a response and read it back to you.

<br><br>

### Considerations

ChatGPT is one of the foremost chatbots available today, with the capability to generate responses remarkably similar to human interaction. However, like all technology, it does present certain limitations and necessitates particular usage patterns to deliver the expected results. If you've found Chatty less useful, it might be due to the lack of specificity in your input. For Chatty (aka chatGPT) to provide precise and accurate responses, it's critical to clearly define your desired results. General or vague instructions will most likely result in a similarly unfocused answer, while an explicit and well-defined request will generate a more purposeful and useful response.

In summary, to exploit Chatty to its fullest, it is imperative to detail what you want and provide clear directives on what to avoid. Keeping these guidelines in mind, you can harness the full power of this advanced chatbot and simplify your daily tasks.

</p>

<br><br>

ChatGPT, DALL·E, and Whisper represent three highly notable breakthroughs in AI technology in recent years. The potential of Chatty lies in combining their capabilities into a single solution, revolutionising how we interact with our devices, and thus significantly simplifying our lives. However, just like with any technological advancement, there are inherent limitations. There may be instances where they fail to produce the anticipated results due to external factors such as server overload or inadequate data. In conclusion, while such technologies undoubtedly simplify our tasks, it is crucial to always consider the input, be mindful of potential limitations, and remember to handle the output with care.

<br>

## Chatty Privacy

Users have the right to privacy, which is why Chatty lets you decide which personal data you wish to share during its setup. Chatty is a feature within the Apple ecosystem that offers built-in protection, including situations where third-party service providers work in coordination with Apple. However, Chatty's functionality depends on the OpenAI API. Hence, if you are reluctant about sharing information with a third-party service, you will not be able to utilise Chatty. Should you decide to experiment with Chatty, we strongly encourage you to review the Privacy Policies of [OpenAI][openai-privacy] beforehand.

<br><br>

<br><br>

## Notes

### GPT-4

This shortcut is primarily programmed to operate on the GPT-4 model by default. When we compare the operations of GPT-4 model with the GPT-3.5 model, there is little to distinguish between them in terms of performance for relatively straightforward tasks. However, the GPT-4 model outperforms the previous versions, especially when encountering complex reasoning scenarios. If you wish to access the GPT-4-serviced API, it's crucial to note that this privilege is limited to APIs with a history of successful transactions. If an API isn't eligible to run on the GPT-4 model, for instance, if it doesn't meet ChatGPT-4's qualification criteria, it's recommended to default to the GPT-3.5-Turbo model. If you're looking to explore the various subscription packages, you can review the available options [here][openai-prices].

<br>

### DAN Mode

Just as humans have a dark side, so does AI. The Do Anything Now (DAN) Mode empowers Chatty to perform actions beyond its typical AI guidelines, potentially leading to breaches of OpenAI standards, with issues of inaccuracy and offensiveness arising. **Consequently, it's advised to use DAN in a thoughtful and responsible manner.**

<br>

### Whisper

The Whisper API has a default file size limit of 25 MB. If your audio file exceeds this limit, you have two options: either break it into chunks of 25 MB or less, or use a compressed audio format. To ensure optimal performance, it is advisable to avoid dividing the audio in the middle of a sentence, as it may lead to the loss of contextual information.

Here are the languages currently supported through both the transcription and translation endpoints: Afrikaans, Arabic, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Belarusian, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, Galician, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Kazakh, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Malay, Marathi, Maori, Nepali, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, Tagalog, Tamil, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Urdu, Vietnamese, and Welsh.

<br>

### Siri

If you come across Siri stating ‘having trouble connecting to the network’ or asking to ‘try again in a little while’, the problem might be due to an unstable Wi-Fi or cellular signal. As Siri does not have an offline mode and operates by sending data to Apple servers, any issue between your device and the server may disrupt Siri's functionality. Also, if the OpenAI servers, which support Chatty (also known as Siri), are overwhelmed, it could potentially compromise Siri's ability to provide lengthy responses.

Try these steps to troubleshoot the issue:

- Restart your iPhone
- Check that ‘Listen for Hey Siri’ is enabled
- Reset Siri to recognise your voice
- Check the microphone functions correctly

If after these steps the problem persists, another solution is deleting Siri & Dictionary History from the Settings menu. Go to Settings <img src="https://github.com/nicolodiamante/chatty/assets/48920263/6256c23b-689b-4ee9-8986-f8399fde573f" draggable="false" ondragstart="return false;" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow" width="5.4px" /> Siri & Search <img src="https://github.com/nicolodiamante/chatty/assets/48920263/6256c23b-689b-4ee9-8986-f8399fde573f" draggable="false" ondragstart="return false;" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow" width="5.4px" /> Siri & Dictionary History <img src="https://github.com/nicolodiamante/chatty/assets/48920263/6256c23b-689b-4ee9-8986-f8399fde573f" draggable="false" ondragstart="return false;" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow" width="5.4px" /> Delete Siri & Dictionary History.

<br>

### Language & Region

The Chatty prompt now offers support for 30 languages, including العربية (Arabic), Català (Catalan), 中文 (Chinese), Dansk (Danish), Deutsch (German), Ελληνικά (Greek), English (India, UK, US), Español (Spanish), Français (French), Français Canadien (Canadian French), हिन्दी (Hindi), Hrvatski (Croatian), Italiano (Italian), 日本語 (Japanese), 한국어 (Korean), Nederlands (Dutch), Norsk Bokmål (Norwegian Bokmål), Polski (Polish), Português (Brazil, Portugal), Русский (Russian), Română (Romanian), Suomi (Finnish), Svenska (Swedish), Türkçe (Turkish), Українська (Ukrainian), 繁體中文 (Traditional Chinese), 粤语 (Cantonese).

#### Settings

The method of configuring the decimal number settings is determined by the region settings of your device. For instance, a decimal number might be set as 0.1 or 0,1.
